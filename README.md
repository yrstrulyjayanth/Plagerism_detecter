# Plagiarism Detection System

Welcome to the Plagiarism Detection System project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to identify instances of plagiarism in text documents. The primary objective of this project is to detect and report duplicated content across different documents, ensuring academic integrity and content originality.

## Project Overview

The Plagiarism Detection System aims to analyze and compare text documents to identify similarities and potential plagiarism. This system can be used for academic papers, articles, or any text-based content to ensure that the content is original and not copied from other sources.

## Features

- **Plagiarism Detection**: Identify potential plagiarism by comparing text documents.
- **Similarity Scoring**: Provides a similarity score to quantify the degree of duplication.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports highlighting potential sources of plagiarism.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilize a pre-trained model for immediate detection.
- **Custom Training**: Option to train the model with a custom dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Plagiarism Detection System, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy
- Scikit-learn
- Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/plagiarism-detection.git
    cd plagiarism-detection
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

#### Detecting Plagiarism with the Pre-trained Model

To check for plagiarism between two documents, run:

```bash
python detect_plagiarism.py --doc1 path/to/document1.txt --doc2 path/to/document2.txt
```

Replace `path/to/document1.txt` and `path/to/document2.txt` with the paths to the text files you want to compare.

#### Training the Model

To train the model with your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format with columns for `text1` and `text2`:

    ```csv
    text1,text2
    "This is a sample text.","This is a similar sample text."
    ```

2. Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py --data-file path/to/dataset.csv
    ```

This will train the model and save the weights to `model_weights.h5`.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on a test dataset, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py --data-file path/to/test-dataset.csv
```

## Results

The model achieves a detection accuracy of [insert accuracy]% on the test set. For detailed performance metrics and examples, refer to the `evaluation_report.md` file.

## Visualization

Visualize similarity scores and detection results using:

```bash
python visualize.py --results-file path/to/results.json
```

This will generate charts and visualizations showing the results of the plagiarism detection.
